                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This design research proposes the question of how a digital
                outdoor recreation tool could support Indigenous sovereignty
                through community engagement and embodied user learning. Our
                proposed digital tool, Illahee, is a placemaking outdoor
                recreation application with embodied interaction provided
                through guided audio-visual channels. Illahee aims to promote
                ecological awareness of and engagement with Indigenous history,
                culture, traditional knowledge systems and sovereignty
                efforts.</p>

                <p>We looked for competitors that specialized in hiking/outdoor
                    exercise apps, audio tour apps, and in indigenous placemaking.
                    We chose 5 competitors: AllTrails, Strava, Anytour, VoiceMap,
                    and Whose Land. All have Android and iOS mobile apps, while
                    AllTrails, Strava, VoiceMap, and Whose Land have desktop sites

                      <h5>Placemaking in Indigenious Sovereignty Efforts</h5>
                      <p>Placemaking, as defined by Wikipedia, is the
                      “multi-faceted approach to the planning, design and
                      management of public spaces. Placemaking capitalizes on a
                      local community's assets, inspiration, and potential, with
                      the intention of creating public spaces that promote
                      people's health, happiness, and well-being.”</p>
                      <p>The approach of placemaking is a core principle in
                      contemporary Indigenous sovereignty efforts - the
                      reclaiming of ancestral lands and the traditional
                      resources therein through activism and policy centered on
                      independent management.</p>
                      <p>In her landmark book, Recovering the Sacred: The Power
                      of Naming and Claiming (1999), author Winona LaDuke
                      explores the plurality of Indigenous placemaking. From the
                      Klamath, Modoc, Yahooskin Paiute, Karuk, Yurok and Hupa
                      tribes of the Klamath river basin working to restore
                      stewardship of sickened rivers to the tribal communities
                      to the reclamation of horsemanship and homelands by the
                      Nez Perce tribes, placemaking is as diverse as the tribal
                      nations of this continent. In order to support these
                      efforts, each experience must be approached with a nuanced
                      understanding of place and community.</p>
                      <p>Place naming, a specific type of placemaking, is
                      another approach to sovereignty awareness and activism.
                      From land acknowledgement statements to traditional
                      greetings and name sharing, Indigenious language is a
                      powerful vehicle for identity reclamation. The ‘renaming’
                      of place, particularly sacred places, “inscribe the
                      landscape with meaning” (Gray & Rück, 2019) and challenge
                      accepted colonial narratives about the land and its
                      inhabitants.</p>
                      <p>What if placemaking and place naming, as it relates to
                      Indigenious sovereignty efforts, could take the form of a
                      digital tool for all those experiencing a place,
                      Indigenious or otherwise? Could this tool support
                      cross-cultural education and awareness? Could this tool
                      support sovereignty efforts and ultimately influence
                      public policy?</p>
                      <h5>HCI in Digital Placemaking</h5>
                      <p>The role of HCI in digital placemaking has been
                      thoroughly researched and documented by HCI researcher
                      Clara Crivellaro and her colleagues in two key research
                      works: Contesting the City: Enacting the Political Through
                      Digitally Supported Urban Walks (2015) and Re-Making
                      Places: HCI, ‘Community Building’ and Change (2016).</p>
                      <p>In ‘Contesting the City: Enacting the Political Through
                      Digitally Supported Urban Walks’, Crivellaro, et al.
                      explore how “situated discovery” and “articulation of
                      issues at the intersection between the politics of place
                      making and city planning” can challenge normative
                      representations of place and give voice to marginalized
                      narratives. (Crivellaro et al., 2015, pg. 2966)</p>
                      <p>Crivellaro, et al. suggest that allowing for everyday
                      actions, uses and interactions to drive interrogations of
                      singular histories inherently contributes to a plurality
                      of experiences. This plurality is key in dismantling
                      ahistorical assumptions that uphold capitalist-colonialist
                      ideology and white supremacy and central to our design
                      research.</p>
                      <p>In Re-Making Places: HCI, ‘Community Building’ and
                      Change, a publication from the following year, Crivellaro,
                      et al. dig into how the intervention of “prevailing,
                      normative practices and existing spatial configurations in
                      order to support the articulation of values, issues and
                      open up the conditions of possibility,” with the paramount
                      importance of embodied storytelling explained:</p>
                      <p class="px-3">“Stories find their value not in their
                      claims to legitimate truths about community and place.
                      Instead, it’s in their uncertain and open-ended nature,
                      and in how they emerge through varied, situated encounters
                      and contingent situations, that they posit an “equality of
                      intelligence” (rather than ‘sanctioned’ knowledge)]. That
                      they are plural, situated, partial and contingent doesn’t
                      discount them, rather it’s this that allows them to
                      contain the possibilities for the future.” (Crivellaro et
                      al., 2016, pg. 2966)</p>
                      <p>The concept of pluralistic storytelling as a reframing
                      of history is a core tenet of the initial design
                      approaches to Illahee.</p>
                      <p>Re-Making Places also stresses the ‘centrality of
                      physicality and the need for HCI design to adopt methods
                      and approaches to engage with embodied practices and
                      sensorial aspects of places,” (p2967) where “material
                      engagements in place making, socio-political issues, lived
                      experiences and practices are brought to the fore and
                      given form.”(Crivellaro et al., 2015, pg. 2967) The
                      cohesion of physical experience and storytelling aligns
                      with proposed Indigienous forms of embodiment discussed in
                      the next section.</p>

                      the Mediated XicanIndio Resolana, authors Martínez, et al.
                      discuss theoretical and educational needs of decolonized

                      pg. 165)</p>
                      <p>For the purposes of understanding how digital
                      placemaking and storytelling could support sovereignty
                      efforts, it is critical that the method of learning “take
                      place through embodied and lived experience.” (Martinez et
                      al., 2010, pg. 165)</p>
                      <p>Most interestingly, Martinez, et al. posit that beyond
                      indigenous knowing, there is indegnious being - a
                      reflection of the local community requiring presence of
                      the local community, through a practice of interaction
                      with others within the context of a situated environment.
                      This practice of indigenious being is central to our
                      design research: situating first person or testimonio
                      storytelling within an associated ecological environment
                      as a practice of reciprocity and accountability.</p>
                      <p>Martinez, et al. emphasize the critical nature of
                      participatory design by local Indigenous communities -
                      learning is often considered a sacred act (p. 168) and the
                      expository nature of sharing ‘knowledge’ with unwilling or
                      unengaged audiences could be extractionary and deeply
                      harmful. The concept of sovereignty must extend to how and
                      what knowledge is shared - and how that learning is
                      received.</p>

                <h2>Interviews</h2>
                <p>We conducted one on one semi-structured interviews with
                participants to collect feedback to help us better understand
                our problem and focus our efforts. Of note, we solicited
                feedback from both BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) and non-BIPOC participants. This effort
                was to ensure Indigenous representation and perspectives in our
                design, as well as account for non-BIPOC perspectives.</p>

                <div class="row shadow bg-white rounded justify-content-between my-2 mx-2 py-2 mx-md-3 mx-lg-5 p-2">
                    <p>By recording our observations along a set of inductively coded categories in our affinity diagram, we ultimately organized our interview findings into four themes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Concepts of place</li>
                        <li>Digital habits in outdoor recreation</li>
                        <li>Definitions of sovereignty</li>
                        <li>Digital tool to support sovereignty efforts</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>  
                <h4>Concepts of Place</h4>  
                <ul>
                    <li>All interview participants described individual concepts
                    of place, with emphasis on the idea of present existence, or
                    to be currently in a physical location, as well as the idea
                    of familial or ancestral ties.</li>
                    <li>“A sense of place to me means an internal deep
                    connection to an ancestral place that I can consider home
                    and have a relationship with,” stated one participant.</li>
                    <li>Many participants described ‘home’ or ‘nature’ as
                    important places and several participants alluded to a
                    deeper, more spiritual connection.</li>
                    <li>No participants described ‘place’ as related to a
                    community outside of family or as a shared resource.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Digital Habits in Outdoor Recreation</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Participants described a variety of activities: fishing,
                    running, walking, hiking, gardening, and off-road
                    driving.</li>
                    <li>All of our participants utilize technology to augment
                    their outdoor recreation experience, but the individual
                    tools varied.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Three participants listed applications with GPS or
                        other mapping technology, including navigation
                        applications like ‘Siri’ or Waze and a golf course
                        application that, “shows you where you are on the
                        green.”</li>
                        <li>Strava was also used by one participant to record
                        statistics such as bike ride times or distances, and
                        another participant described using an application to
                        “track the time, miles, and calories burned when I walk
                        or run.”</li>
                        <li>Two participants listed their phone camera as a tool
                        often used when recreating outdoors, and one of these
                        participants explained that she used social media
                        applications such as Instagram and Facebook in
                        conjunction with her camera in order to share her
                        photos.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <h4>Definitions of Sovereignty</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>All but one interview participant had an idea or
                    personal definition of sovereignty, which included concepts
                    such as: independent management or control by people
                    residing in a specific place; individuals having a say in
                    how something is designed, or reflective of intended use;
                    ruling of a place.</li>
                    <li>One non-BIPOC participant stated that, “sovereignty is
                    not really clear in a lot of places, and often are stripped
                    of sovereignty even if they are sovereign in name.”</li>
                    <li>One participant that identified as BIPOC described
                    sovereignty as an, “Indigneous claim to a place that has
                    been there since time immemorial. It allows us to exercise
                    control and management of that place in a tribal and
                    cultural way with a certain level of control and
                    management.”</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Digital Tool to Support Sovereignty Efforts</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>All participants believe that technology can support
                    sovereignty efforts, but with different outcomes.</li>
                    <li>Our BIPOC participants believed that technology could “do so
                        much” for communities.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>“bring back elders in a digital form to tell stories”</li>
                            <li>“Indigenous knowledge needs to be passed to children,
                            grandchildren and even adults that don’t know how to exist
                            or do anything in nature anymore. Indigneous people need to
                            embrace technology to keep our language, our ceremony, our
                            traditions, family structure, parenting”</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Non BIPOC participants described the ability of
                    technology to support sovereignty efforts somewhat
                    differently.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>One participant described how technology could help
                            promote open dialogue, while another stated that technology
                            could share information about what tribes or cultures live
                            in that area and what “places are controlled by certain
                            people.”</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Contextual Inquiry</h2>
                <p>We included contextual inquiry in our interviews to better
                gather initial design impressions from participants and better
                understand what future users might expect to see in our
                application. The contextual inquiry utilized a digital narrative
                which provided visual information, as well as sharing
                information about some of the features of the application such
                as placemaking, environmentalism, and the goal of fostering
                sovereignty.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The response to the product showcased in the digital
                        narrative was overwhelmingly positive, with many
                        participants expressing interest in learning more and
                        using the application.</li>
                        <li>BIPOC participant stated: “I also really like the
                        Indigenous twist on the website but the website has a
                        lot for people who aren’t Indigenous to open their mind
                        to more possibilities than just walking on the trail and
                        enjoying the scenery.”</li>
                        <li>However, one participant was confused on how this
                        application could be used to educate future generations,
                        stating that the information presented in the digital
                        narrative is “too vague.”</li>
                        <li>All participants mentioned that the focus on
                        Indigenous culture and sacred places also piqued their
                        curiosity and understood that they would be downloading
                        an application used to further awareness of Indigenous
                        history and perspectives.</li>
                        <li>One participant stated that they could only see
                        themselves using this during solo hikes.</li>
                        <li>“I’m not sure I want to have technology during a
                        hike because sometimes I like to disconnect and just
                        enjoy the outdoors.”</li>

                <h2>Lo-fi Prototype</h2>
                <p>We created our low fidelity wireframes based on our sketches
                created in Invision. The sketches allowed us to visualize our
                design concepts and as we worked on the low fidelity prototype
                in Figma we made changes and improvements. For the most part,
                the sketches translated well and we kept most of the design
                concepts intact. We felt confident in our design and the
                direction we were heading in.</p>

                        rated the ease of this task 4.83 out of 5 - ‘very easy’
                        to add.</li>
                        <li>Six out of six participants were able to
                        successfully enable the narration feature and rated the
                        ease of doing so 4.67 out of 5, between ‘easy’ and ‘very
                        easy’ to enable.</li>
                        <li>Only 67% of our participants stated ‘true’ when
                        asked if they found the narration feature engaging and
                        would use it in their outdoor recreation
                        experiences.</li>
                        <li>Our user’s overall satisfaction with the application
                        prototype was 4.58 out of 5, between ‘satisfied’ and
                        ‘extremely satisfied’.</li>
                        <li>33% of our participants found the icon for switching
                        screens between the ‘trail navigation’ and the ‘narrator
                        view’ confusing and challenged their completion of a
                        task.</li>
                        <li>Out of the participants that evaluated the dual
                        screen prototype, 50% of participants stated that more
                        clear indication of how to switch screens between the
                        narrator and the hiking map would improve the
                        application.</li>

                <h2>Hi-fi Prototype</h2>
                <p>Overall, users liked the concept of the application and the
                general design. A benefit of switching to high fidelity was the
                ability to add images. We added images to trail locations to
                give the user a better sense of the trail locations and their
                environments.</p>

                <h2>Retrospective</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Overall, our research demonstrated an overwhelmingly
                    positive interest for engaging with Indigenous culture and
                    history, demonstrated by outcomes in our interviews and
                    usability testing.</li>
                    <li>Many users commented on the uniqueness and timeliness of
                    the idea and a high degree of learning about local ecology
                    was also expressed.</li>
                    <li>Users were split on the usefulness and necessity of our
                    proposed narration feature, with some participants
                    expressing hesitancy with using this feature for fear that
                    it might detract from their enjoyment and engagement with
                    outdoor recreation.</li>
                    <li>Further design iterations and research is needed to
                    refine features and understand what content is most engaging
                    and relevant.</li>
                    <li>Future research could include participatory design
                    methods with Indigenous communities to create multimedia
                    content, which could then be included and evaluated in
                    future design iterations.</li>
                    <li>Future research should evaluate whether or not content
                    is effective in user learning and understanding of
                    Indigenious histories, knowledge systems and sovereignty
                    efforts.</li>
