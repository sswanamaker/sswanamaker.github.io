                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This design research proposes the question of how a digital
                outdoor recreation tool could support Indigenous sovereignty
                through community engagement and embodied user learning. Our
                proposed digital tool, Illahee, is a placemaking outdoor
                recreation application with embodied interaction provided
                through guided audio-visual channels. Illahee aims to promote
                ecological awareness of and engagement with Indigenous history,
                culture, traditional knowledge systems and sovereignty
                efforts.</p>

                <p>We looked for competitors that specialized in hiking/outdoor
                    exercise apps, audio tour apps, and in indigenous placemaking.
                    We chose 5 competitors: AllTrails, Strava, Anytour, VoiceMap,
                    and Whose Land. All have Android and iOS mobile apps, while
                    AllTrails, Strava, VoiceMap, and Whose Land have desktop sites
                    that provide the portion of the features present in the mobile
                    apps.</p>
                    <p>We conducted a preliminary analysis of features we would like
                    to include in our proposed application and a secondary analysis
                    on web and mobile navigational structure, tour/trail finding
                    capabilities, GPS/map navigation, and overall use satisfaction
                    of each competitor. The competitive analysis helped us
                    understand marketplace opportunity and research precedents and
                    also helped guide the initial design of our application.</p>

                <h2>Literature Review</h2>
                <p>Selections for our literature review focused on existing research
                that engaged with our primary research question: how can a digital
                outdoor recreation tool become a catalyst for sovereignty through
                community engagement and user learning?</p>
                <p>Scholarly works were selected through keyword searches and
                reviewed for relevance and appropriate precedents.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the seminal work by Indigenous environmental
                scholar and activist Winona LaDuke was reviewed and served as an
                important contextual resource in understanding how placemaking and
                naming, traditional knowledge systems and environmental stewardship
                connect in Indigenous sovereignty efforts.</p>

                <p>We conducted one on one semi-structured interviews with
                participants to collect feedback to help us better understand
                our problem and focus our efforts. Of note, we solicited
                feedback from both BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) and non-BIPOC participants. This effort
                was to ensure Indigenous representation and perspectives in our
                design, as well as account for non-BIPOC perspectives.</p>

                    <p>By recording our observations along a set of inductively coded categories in our affinity diagram, we ultimately organized our interview findings into four themes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Concepts of place</li>
                        <li>Digital habits in outdoor recreation</li>
                        <li>Definitions of sovereignty</li>
                        <li>Digital tool to support sovereignty efforts</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>  
                <h4>Concepts of Place</h4>  
                <ul>
                    <li>All interview participants described individual concepts
                    of place, with emphasis on the idea of present existence, or
                    to be currently in a physical location, as well as the idea
                    of familial or ancestral ties.</li>
                    <li>“A sense of place to me means an internal deep
                    connection to an ancestral place that I can consider home
                    and have a relationship with,” stated one participant.</li>
                    <li>Many participants described ‘home’ or ‘nature’ as
                    important places and several participants alluded to a
                    deeper, more spiritual connection.</li>
                    <li>No participants described ‘place’ as related to a
                    community outside of family or as a shared resource.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Digital Habits in Outdoor Recreation</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Participants described a variety of activities: fishing,
                    running, walking, hiking, gardening, and off-road
                    driving.</li>
                    <li>All of our participants utilize technology to augment
                    their outdoor recreation experience, but the individual
                    tools varied.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Three participants listed applications with GPS or
                        other mapping technology, including navigation
                        applications like ‘Siri’ or Waze and a golf course
                        application that, “shows you where you are on the
                        green.”</li>
                        <li>Strava was also used by one participant to record
                        statistics such as bike ride times or distances, and
                        another participant described using an application to
                        “track the time, miles, and calories burned when I walk
                        or run.”</li>
                        <li>Two participants listed their phone camera as a tool
                        often used when recreating outdoors, and one of these
                        participants explained that she used social media
                        applications such as Instagram and Facebook in
                        conjunction with her camera in order to share her
                        photos.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <h4>Definitions of Sovereignty</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>All but one interview participant had an idea or
                    personal definition of sovereignty, which included concepts
                    such as: independent management or control by people
                    residing in a specific place; individuals having a say in
                    how something is designed, or reflective of intended use;
                    ruling of a place.</li>
                    <li>One non-BIPOC participant stated that, “sovereignty is
                    not really clear in a lot of places, and often are stripped
                    of sovereignty even if they are sovereign in name.”</li>
                    <li>One participant that identified as BIPOC described
                    sovereignty as an, “Indigneous claim to a place that has
                    been there since time immemorial. It allows us to exercise
                    control and management of that place in a tribal and
                    cultural way with a certain level of control and
                    management.”</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Digital Tool to Support Sovereignty Efforts</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>All participants believe that technology can support
                    sovereignty efforts, but with different outcomes.</li>
                    <li>Our BIPOC participants believed that technology could “do so
                        much” for communities.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>“bring back elders in a digital form to tell stories”</li>
                            <li>“Indigenous knowledge needs to be passed to children,
                            grandchildren and even adults that don’t know how to exist
                            or do anything in nature anymore. Indigneous people need to
                            embrace technology to keep our language, our ceremony, our
                            traditions, family structure, parenting”</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Non BIPOC participants described the ability of
                    technology to support sovereignty efforts somewhat
                    differently.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>One participant described how technology could help
                            promote open dialogue, while another stated that technology
                            could share information about what tribes or cultures live
                            in that area and what “places are controlled by certain
                            people.”</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Contextual Inquiry</h2>
                <p>We included contextual inquiry in our interviews to better
                gather initial design impressions from participants and better
                understand what future users might expect to see in our
                application. The contextual inquiry utilized a digital narrative
                which provided visual information, as well as sharing
                information about some of the features of the application such
                as placemaking, environmentalism, and the goal of fostering
                sovereignty.</p>

                    <h5>Key Findings</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The response to the product showcased in the digital
                        narrative was overwhelmingly positive, with many
                        participants expressing interest in learning more and
                        using the application.</li>
                        <li>BIPOC participant stated: “I also really like the
                        Indigenous twist on the website but the website has a
                        lot for people who aren’t Indigenous to open their mind
                        to more possibilities than just walking on the trail and
                        enjoying the scenery.”</li>
                        <li>However, one participant was confused on how this
                        application could be used to educate future generations,
                        stating that the information presented in the digital
                        narrative is “too vague.”</li>
                        <li>All participants mentioned that the focus on
                        Indigenous culture and sacred places also piqued their
                        curiosity and understood that they would be downloading
                        an application used to further awareness of Indigenous
                        history and perspectives.</li>
                        <li>One participant stated that they could only see
                        themselves using this during solo hikes.</li>
                        <li>“I’m not sure I want to have technology during a
                        hike because sometimes I like to disconnect and just
                        enjoy the outdoors.”</li>

                <h2>Lo-fi Prototype</h2>
                <p>We created our low fidelity wireframes based on our sketches
                created in Invision. The sketches allowed us to visualize our
                design concepts and as we worked on the low fidelity prototype
                in Figma we made changes and improvements. For the most part,
                the sketches translated well and we kept most of the design
                concepts intact. We felt confident in our design and the
                direction we were heading in.</p>

                <p>We implemented A/B testing in order to test two different
                designs of the GPS navigation screen and narration screen.
                Prototype one utilized switching between a full screen
                navigation screen and full screen narration screen. Prototype
                two utilized a split screen where navigation and narration
                resided in one screen.</p>

                        Arch Trail’ and the ease of use for finding this
                        specific trail had an average score of 4.83 out of 5,
                        falling between ‘easy’ and ‘very easy’ to find.</li>
                        <li>100% of participants successfully added the ‘Tower

                        rated the ease of this task 4.83 out of 5 - ‘very easy’
                        to add.</li>
                        <li>Six out of six participants were able to

                        ease of doing so 4.67 out of 5, between ‘easy’ and ‘very
                        easy’ to enable.</li>
                        <li>Only 67% of our participants stated ‘true’ when
                        asked if they found the narration feature engaging and
                        would use it in their outdoor recreation

                        ‘extremely satisfied’.</li>
                        <li>33% of our participants found the icon for switching

                        clear indication of how to switch screens between the
                        narrator and the hiking map would improve the

                <p>Overall, users liked the concept of the application and the
                general design. A benefit of switching to high fidelity was the
                ability to add images. We added images to trail locations to

                    usability testing.</li>
                    <li>Many users commented on the uniqueness and timeliness of
                    the idea and a high degree of learning about local ecology
                    was also expressed.</li>
                    <li>Users were split on the usefulness and necessity of our
                    proposed narration feature, with some participants
                    expressing hesitancy with using this feature for fear that
                    it might detract from their enjoyment and engagement with
                    outdoor recreation.</li>
                    <li>Further design iterations and research is needed to
                    refine features and understand what content is most engaging
                    and relevant.</li>
                    <li>Future research could include participatory design
                    methods with Indigenous communities to create multimedia
                    content, which could then be included and evaluated in
                    future design iterations.</li>
                    <li>Future research should evaluate whether or not content
                    is effective in user learning and understanding of
                    Indigenious histories, knowledge systems and sovereignty
