        <h3 class="heading">Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>The widespread adoption of technologies and social media brings to
        question, what will happen to these digital assets (digital photos,
        videos, documents, etc.) after the users pass away? In this project, we
        explored user needs for a technology addressing this problem that
        considers the wishes of the deceased person. We began this project with
        scenario-based observations of eight participants. Our scenario asked
        participants to imagine themselves helping their critically ill aunt
        with their digital assets. We organized our notes from the observations
        using the AEIOU (activities, environment, interactions, objects, and
        users) framework. </p>
        <p>After performing our observations, we recruited eight new
        participants to take part in interviews. After receiving consent, we
        asked them questions about storing/sharing digital assets, potential
        preparations for assets after passing, and about any accounts they may
        have. We analyzed our interview by coding, creating an affinity diagram
        on Mural.com, spectrums, and personas.</p>
        <p>In the final stage of our research, we performed a survey with 47
        participants. We asked them questions about how their digital assets
        should be handled after they died, as well as their comfort level with
        someone else handling them. We also asked if participants were
        interested in digital memorials created in their honor as well as their
        social media use. From our findings, we learned that users prefer their
        artifacts to be handled by the following in order: friends, siblings,
        then parents. We also learned that users like the idea of memorials but
        would not want to make one for themselves, and the management of their
        social media accounts are not very important.</p>
        <p>Major implications of the design of our technology are as follows:</p>
        <div class="implications">
            <p>• <span class="bold">‘How-to’ guide</span> – All users encountered difficulty when it came to
            finding information on how to organize social media presence. Based on
            this finding we would need to have precise instructions or
            recommendations on how to organize social media accounts when developing
            and designing this product.</p>
            <p>• <span class="bold">Consolidation feature</span> – Several users wanted a feature to
            consolidate their social media accounts.</p>
            <p>• <span class="bold">Cloud service</span> – All our participants stored their digital assets in
            the cloud. This finding indicated that our product would have to be a
            cloud-based product that is easily accessible from the participant’s
            browsers.</p>
            <p>• <span class="bold">Dead man’s switch</span> – Users wanted a feature where preselected files
            and/or accounts will be deleted once they are gone. Any design will need
            to include a feature where users can select what files or accounts to
            keep or delete, and a private key that they or a designated individual
            can input to activate this feature.</p>
            <p>• <span class="bold">Memorial page creation</span> – From our observations, and interviews we
            determined that participants had a favorable view towards online
            memorial pages, and many would like one created for them in the event of
            their passing. However, the surveys found that only half of the
            respondents would want to set up a memorial page for themselves. This
            indicated that our design should include an optional feature of creating
            a memorial page that will showcase and present digital artifacts that
            users designate.</p>
        </div>   
    </div>
    <div class="observation">
        <h3 class="heading">Observation</h3>
        <p>We began our exploration by observering how participants would share
        their loved one's digital artifacts in preparation for their loved one's
        passing. We recruited eight participants through social media. Due to
        the Covid-19 epidemic, we conducted our observations through Zoom.</p>
        <p>We then sent each participant a document with written instructions
        and stock photos to for use in a solving a scenario-based problem:</p>
        <p class="task">Imagine your aunt, an avid photographer and writer, is
        critically ill; everyone in the family is distraught and shocked at how
        swiftly her condition worsened. You, being the most versed in
        technology, are asked to help your aunt with organizing her digital
        assets and social media accounts so she can share her collected
        artifacts with her family and friends when she is gone.</p>
        <p>After presenting the scenario, we gave them two tasks: (1) Using the
        photos we sent earlier, please demonstrate, while sharing your screen,
        how you would store and share these sentimental digital files, the
        photo's of your aunt's 50th birthday with your aunt's close family
        members once she is gone; (2) Show how you would help your aunt organize
        her social media presence.</p>
        <p>From there, we organized our observations into the AEIOU framework to
        categorize our findings using Stormboard, an online affinity
        diagramming tool. We then summarized common steps into a flow
        diagram.</p>
        <h4>Findings</h4>
        <div class="obsdiagram">
            <div class="diagram1">
                <img class="diagram" src="images/diagram1.jpg">
                <p>In our observations, we noted that most participants uploaded
                the stock photos to a cloud service (e.g Google Drive or Adobe
                Lightroom) in order to share the photos.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="diagram2">
                <img class="diagram" src="images/diagram2.jpg">
                <p>Our participants prefered to also use the cloud for storing
                their digital artifacts, while some also placed the artifacts in
                a secondary location such as their local computer drive or an
                external drive. When participants stored the digital artifacts,
                they created folders and most labled it "Aunt's 50th Birthday"
                in order to keep their directories organized. This along with
                the previous finding, implies that a product geared towards
                storing and sharing digital assets will be cloud-based and
                accessible from a web browser.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="diagram3">
                <img class="diagram" src="images/diagram3.jpg">
                <p>Participants came to various conclusions when deciding how
                they would organize their aunt's social media and digital
                artifacts. Three participants stated that they would go through
                the artifacts with their aunt to choose what to keep and what to
                delete. While others mentioned creating a memorial page,
                emailing or storing all the digital assets on the cloud so they
                could share the link with their family.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="diagram4">
                <img class="diagram" src="images/diagram4.jpg">
                <p>Many participants remarked that they did not know how they
                would go about completing the tasks that were presented. We
                observed that participants would turn to Google in order to find
                ideas and some wanted written instructions or checklists on what
                they should do. One of our participants mentioned how he had
                many different accounts and the trouble it would be to go
                through each of them. These comments implied that users would
                benefit from a product that has clear instructions and
                recommendations on what can be included under social media
                presence such as Facebook, Instagram, and Kakao. This product
                should also have the ability to consolidate and access all of a
                user’s accounts from one place.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>We then created a flow diagram to depict how our participants stored and shared digital artifacts.</p>
        <div class="flowbox">
            <img class="flow" src="images/flowdiagram.jpg">
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="interviews">
        <h3 class="heading">Interviews</h3>
        <p>Next, we interviewed eight new participants to gain a deeper insight
        in to how users currently store their digital artifacts and what they
        will do with either their own or their loved one's digital assets in the
        event of death. We also asked for their experiece, if any, of veiwing or
        creating a memorial page or an obituary. The interviews were conducted through Zoom.</p>
        <p>We transcribed our interviews then uploaded them to Atlas.ti. We did
        structural coding, individual open coding, and organized our codes into
        themes using a Mural Board. From this information, we built our personas.</p>
        <h4>Findings</h4>
        <div class="intdiagram">
            <div class="diagram5">
                <img class="diagrami" src="images/diagram5.jpg">
                <p>Our insight on how participants store their data mirrored the
                findings in our observations: cloud storage is the most
                prominent method of saving artifacts. Similarly, most
                participants organized their digital artifacts in some way,
                either chronologically or thematically. This implies that our
                product would need a way for users to organize the digital
                artifacts that they upload on to our product. Passwords was a
                new insight we explored. Three participants revealed that they
                store their passwords in a password manager or written down.
                Half of the participants admitted that they use the same
                passwords with slight variations for almost all of their
                accounts. These insights revealed that our technology would need
                users to be able to input their passwords so that their loved
                ones will be able to access their accounts after their
                death.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="diagram6">
                <img class="diagrami" src="images/diagram6.jpg">
                <p>All but one participant, stated that they would want a family
                member or a close friend to manage their digital assets after
                they pass. One participant stated that they would want "somebody
                external and professional" to avoid placing the responsibility
                of managing their assets to their husband or friends while they
                are grieving. Four participants stated that they would want to
                leave behind some form of instruction for their loved one to
                dictate what they should do with their digital assets. Some
                participants specifically mentioned that they would leave behind
                instructions on what should be deleted after they die. This
                implies that our product should include a "dead-man's switch"
                where digital artifacts or social media accounts that users want
                to be deleted after their death will be automatically deleted
                without having been viewed by others.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="diagram7">
                <img class="diagrami" src="images/diagram7.jpg">
                <div>
                    <p>We also gleaned insight into how participant's view memorial
                        pages. Some participants found memorial pages to be
                        "heartwarming" and "beautiful" and a way to facilitate
                        connections between people, especially those that did not get to
                        attend the funeral. Others expressed differing opinions. One
                        participant remarked that memorial pages seem "impersonal" while
                        another participant said that "it looked like a frozen social
                        media page".</p>
                        <p>Two participants mentioned creating a memorial page
                        for their loved one; both said that they were made through the
                        funeral home. The memorial page was made through the funeral
                        home website where the participants filled out information about
                        their loved one and the memorial page was automatically
                        generated with that information. Both participants said
                        they received a link that they could use to share the memorial
                        page.</p>
                        <p>When asked what type of digital artifacts they would want to
                        share, three participants stated that they would want to share
                        their life’s work with friends and family after they pass.
                        One participant explained, “I think because it's something that I put
                        my heart and soul into, I think it'd be kind of cool if they had
                        like a piece of that... like some sort of momentum for them to
                        keep and remember me by.” Others mentioned that
                        they would want to share their photos or videos. One participant
                        explained his reasoning behind his choice, “I wish I had that
                        from some of my grandparents, you know, some kind of evidence of
                        what I did.”</p>
                </div>
                
            </div>
            <p>While before we had focused on the storing and sharing of
                digital artifacts in prepartion of death, now we began to think
                of how we could display these chosen digital artifacts for
                public view in order for all family members and acquaintances
                to participate.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="specbox">
            <img class="persona1" src="images/persona1.jpg">
            <p>The preparer are users that are using the product to organize
            their social media and digital artifacts in preparation for their
            passing. They have a lot of digital assets stored across various
            locations.</p>
            <img class="persona2" src="images/persona2.jpg">
            <p>The organizer are users that are using the product to organize
            another person's social media or digital artifacts either in
            preparation for this person's passing or after this person has
            passed. They will have to find and upload digital artifacts that
            this person wants in their package.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="surveys">
        <h3 class="heading">Surveys</h3>
        <p>We conducted surveys for our next step. We recruited participants
        through the DePaul University CDM/COMM Participant Pool, and through
        friends and family on social media. To participate in the study, users
        had to be at least 18 years old, and must use at least one of the
        following social media accounts: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn,
        Snapchat, Twitter, Reddit, or Pinterest. Forty-five participants
        completed the survey (28 female-identifying, 16 male-identifying, and 1
        who identifies as other). The ages ranged from 19 to 55.</p>
        <p>We wanted to explore more into how prepared people are, regarding
        their digital artifacts, for their passing. We also measured the level
        of comfort people had about other individuals being able to access their
        digital artifacts or accounts and if they had items they wish to have
        deleted when they die. We also explored receptiveness of creating a
        memorial page to display their digital artifacts.</p>
        <p>We used Excel and R Studio to analyze our data. Based upon our
        observation and interview phases we formed four hypotheses for
        inferential statistical analysis:</p>
        <ul>
            <p>1.	People feel more comfortable with their loved ones accessing
                their digital artifacts compared to others.</p>
            <p>2.	Users have digital
                artifacts that they would like to be deleted upon their death.</p>
            <p>3.  Users feel more prepared for their death as they age. </p>
            <p>4.	The more social media accounts a user has the more likely they would want a
                social media deletion feature.</p>
        </ul>
        <h4>Findings</h4>
        <div class="surveybox">
            <p>This insight regarding deletion of artifacts in preparation for death
            was further explored in our surveys. Of 45 participants, 25 said that
            they do have files they would want deleted in the event of their
            passing. In addition, 24 participants said they would be interested in
            an automated deletion of artifacts, however only 17 participants were
            interested in automated deletion of their social media accounts. </p>
            <p>To explore our hypothesis that people who are older are more prepared
            for their passing, we used a CHI square test and we found no
            significance, we determined that age was not a factor, X2 (120, N = 45)
            = 106.43, p = .81.</p>
            <p>A Kruskal-Wallace test comparing the number of social media accounts
            a participant stated they owned and their willingness for an automatic
            deletion of social media was not significant, H(1) = 1.62, p=.81.</p>
            <p>We asked respondents to rank (Likert scale from 1-5)
            how comfortable they would be with one of the listed persons (parents,
            siblings, extended family, friends, professional) curating their digital
            artifacts after their passing (see figure 3). The results showed that
            respondents would prefer their siblings to curate their digital
            artifacts. Parents and friends were the second most preferred.</p>

            <p>Survey respondents were asked if they ever had a conversation with
            their loved one regarding distribution of their own or their loved one’s
            artifacts after death: most (35 of 45) have not have this conversation.
            Similarly, most (34 of 45) participants also did not know their loved
            one's wishes regarding their digital artifacts and 23 of 45 participants
            were not sure of the location of their loved one’s artifacts (see figure
            4). When asked on the level of preparedness they felt regarding their own
            digital artifacts, 30 out of 45 participants did not feel confident as
            their plan for their digital assets.</p>

            <p>In our survey, 28 out of 45 participants responded that they do not
            want a memorial page set up after their passing. The 17 participants
            that did want a memorial page were asked to rate (on a Likert scale from
            1-5) which feature they would like to have on their memorial page (see
            figure 5). Respondents rated photos and videos highly. Having
            participant’s life’s work, biography, mementos, and posting features was
            also seen as important features to present.</p>

    <div class="discussion">
        <h3 class="heading">Discussion</h3>
        <p>The proliferation of technology-based social media have created a new
        category of assets; i.e. digitally-based. Additionally, with the
        development of the Internet, “this digital legacy or digital asset is a
        reality that lies no longer solely on a hard disk, and may be available
        in a wide access network” (Gray & Coulton, 2013). It was our aim in this
        project to understand the user needs for a technology-based solution to
        help them store, organize, and distribute digital assets after they have
        passed. We conducted eight observations and followed with eight
        interviews. We then conducted a survey with 45 participants. We
        organized our findings into three categories: digital artifact
        management, access, and preparation. The findings had several
        implications for design that are discussed in the following
        sections.</p>
        <h4>Top Level Findings and Implications for Design</h4>
        <p class="subhead">Cloud-Based</p>
        <p>There was a prevalence of the use of cloud services in our study.
        Participants in our observations, stored their digital assets in the
        cloud using Google Drive, Dropbox, or other services and they shared
        these assets by generating a link to send to others. This was supported
        in our interviews as half of the participants mentioned using the cloud
        to store their digital artifacts. Survey results also showed that
        respondent’s loved ones store their digital artifacts on the cloud. All
        the services listed are web-based and do not require a program to be
        downloaded. This implies that a product geared towards storing and
        sharing digital assets will be cloud-based and accessible from a web
        browser.</p>
        <p class="subhead">How-to Guide</p>
        <p>We found participants encountered difficulties finding information on
        how to organize social media presence. Jai and Paul both remarked that
        they would like a checklist of what they should do and of files that
        they should prepare in case of death. These comments implied that users
        would benefit from a product that has clear instructions and
        recommendations on how users can prepare their digital artifacts before
        death.</p>
        <p class="subhead">Consolidation</p>
        <p>Any solution should also consolidate and access all of a user’s
        accounts from one place. One of our participantsin our observations mentioned how it
        would be difficult to manage all his accounts. Four participants during
        the interviews mentioned that their vision for a product would include a
        way to input their various accounts such as social media or banking
        information. This would also include the feature to consolidate passwords.</p>
        <p class="subhead">Dead Man's Switch</p>
        <p>Many of our interview participants mentioned that they have files
        they would want to be deleted once they passed. Gunther mentioned a dead
        man’s switch or some type of private key that a designated individual
        could use to send out notifications of their death and to delete files.
        More than half of our participants (n=25) in our interviews said that
        they have digital artifacts they would want to be deleted after they
        pass. This indicated that our design should include a feature to allow
        users to select which of their files should be kept and shared and which
        files should be deleted.</p>
        <p class="subhead">Memorial Page Creation</p>
        <p>From our observations, and interviews we determined that participants
        had a favorable view towards online memorial pages and many would like
        one created for them in the event of their passing. The survey results
        showed less than half of the respondents (n=17) wanted a memorial page
        for themselves. This indicated that apart from creating a digital
        artifact package to be distributed, users would also benefit from having
        a choice to display chosen artifacts with friends and family. Based on
        the findings from the surveys the memorial should have features such as
        guest posting, signing book, and ways to add photos and videos.</p>
        <h4>Limitations</h4>
        <p>Our small sample size of eight participants for each observation and
        interview portions created limitations in our study. Our participants in
        the observation and interviews were of similar age (30s) and also from
        the primary locations of Boston, Chicago, San Jose, and Toronto. We were
        also limited in our ability to only record desktop observations because
        many digital assets are stored and shared through people’s phones. Also,
        our ability to only connect to our participants through video made it
        difficult to create a more conversational approach in our recordings,
        leading to a more regimental interview. Limitations in our survey
        included time restraints and participants skipping certain questions
        which reduced the number of participant answers we could use in our
        analysis.</p>
        <p>Future work may involve research into additional features.
        Collaboration and facial recognition of photos to help distribute
        artifacts to specific individuals were mentioned by our participants
        during our research and could be looked into to gather more key insights
        in our product.</p>

    <div class="retro">
        <h3 class="heading">Retrospective</h3>
        <p>I learned a lot from this project. I learned skills in how to observe
        and how to interview. There was difficulty in figuring out how we would
        observe participants through Zoom and while we would have also liked to
        observe how they would go through the tasks on their mobile device, we
        did end up getting great data from our computer observations. I also
        learned how to use Qualtrics and the difficulties in creating a survey
        that will both get usable data and also not create bias. The survey was
        definitly a trial and error and if we had more time, I would have liked
        to create another survey to address additional questions that came up
        from the frist data and questions that we forgot to include. Overall,
        this was a great exploratory project that really illustrated how to
        generate data and ideas from that data in order to influnce how a
        product should develop keeping the users in mind.</p>
