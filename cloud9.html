                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The widespread adoption of technologies and social media
                brings to question, what will happen to these digital assets
                (digital photos, videos, documents, etc.) after an individual
                passes away? In this project, we explored user needs for a
                technology addressing this problem that considers the wishes of
                the deceased person. We conducted scenario-based observations,
                interviews, and a survey.</p>

                <h2>Observation</h2>
                <p>We began our exploration by observing how participants would
                share their loved one's digital artifacts in preparation for
                their loved one's passing. We recruited eight participants
                through social media. Due to the Covid-19 epidemic, we conducted
                our observations through Zoom.</p>
                <p>We then sent each participant a document with written
                instructions and stock photos to for use in a solving a
                scenario-based problem:</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row justify-content-between my-2 mx-5 py-2 border-left border-dark">
            <div class="col">
                <p>Imagine your aunt, an avid photographer and writer, is
                critically ill; everyone in the family is distraught and shocked
                at how swiftly her condition worsened. You, being the most
                versed in technology, are asked to help your aunt with
                organizing her digital assets and social media accounts so she
                can share her collected artifacts with her family and friends
                when she is gone.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <p>After presenting the scenario, we gave them two tasks: (1)
                Using the photos we sent earlier, please demonstrate, while
                sharing your screen, how you would store and share these
                sentimental digital files, the photos of your aunt's 50th
                birthday with your aunt's close family members once she is gone;
                (2) Show how you would help your aunt organize her social media
                presence.</p>
                <p>From there, we organized our observations into the AEIOU
                (activities, environment, interactions, objects, and users)
                framework to categorize our findings using Stormboard, an online
                affinity diagramming tool. We then summarized common steps into
                a flow diagram.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Most participants uploaded the photographs to a cloud
                        service (e.g Google Drive or Adobe Lightroom) to store and
                        share the photographs</li>
                        <li>Participants created folders in order to keep their
                        directories organized</li>
                        <li>Participants wanted a way to pick and choose what to
                        keep of digital artifacts</li>
                        <li>Participants wanted to make a memorial page, cloud
                        folder, or email a consolidated package of digital artifacts
                        to share</li>

                <h2>Interviews</h2>
                <p>Next, we interviewed eight new participants to gain a deeper
                insight into how users currently store their digital artifacts
                and what they will do with either their own or their loved one's
                digital assets in the event of death. We also asked for their
                experience, if any, of viewing or creating a memorial page or an
                obituary. The interviews were conducted through Zoom.</p>

                    <h5>Findings</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users could benefit from the inclusion of a password
                        manager so that anyone with access to the Cloud9 account
                        will be able to log in to social media accounts, bank
                        accounts, ect.</li>
                        <li>Our product should include a "dead-man's switch" where
                        digital artifacts or social media accounts that users want
                        to be deleted after their death will be automatically
                        deleted without having been viewed by others</li>
                        <li>Participants had a favorable view towards memorial pages</li>
                        <li>Most participants wanted to save digital artifacts that
                        had sentimental value to them and share it with friends and
                        family</li>

                <h2>Surveys</h2>
                <p>We conducted surveys for our next step. To participate in the
                study, users had to be at least 18 years old, and must use at
                least one of the following social media accounts: Facebook,
                Instagram, LinkedIn, Snapchat, Twitter, Reddit, or Pinterest.
                Forty-five participants completed the survey (28
                female-identifying, 16 male-identifying, and 1 who identifies as
                other). The ages ranged from 19 to 55.</p>
                <p>We wanted to explore more into how prepared people are
                for their passing, regarding their digital artifacts. We also
                measured the level of comfort people had about other individuals
                being able to access their digital artifacts or accounts and if
                they had items they wish to have deleted when they die. We also
                explored receptiveness of creating a memorial page to display
                their digital artifacts.</p>

                        <li>Over half of the participants said they would be

                        <li>Respondents preferred for their siblings to curate their
                        digital artifacts (in the event of death). Parents and
                        friends were the second most preferred.</li>
                        <li>Respondents rated saving photos and videos highly, along

                <h2>Top Level Findings and Implications for Design</h2>
                <h3>Cloud-Based</h3>
                <p>There was a prevalence of the use of cloud services in our study.
                Participants in our observations, stored their digital assets in the
                cloud using Google Drive, Dropbox, or other services and they shared
                these assets by generating a link to send to others. This was supported
                in our interviews as half of the participants mentioned using the cloud
                to store their digital artifacts. Survey results also showed that
                respondent’s loved ones store their digital artifacts on the cloud. All
                the services listed are web-based and do not require a program to be
                downloaded. This implies that a product geared towards storing and
                sharing digital assets will be cloud-based and accessible from a web
                browser.</p>
                <h3>How-to Guide</h3>
                <p>We found participants encountered difficulties finding information on
                how to organize social media presence. Participants remarked that
                they would like a checklist of what they should do and of files that
                they should prepare in case of death. These comments implied that users
                would benefit from a product that has clear instructions and
                recommendations on how users can prepare their digital artifacts before
                death.</p>
                <h3>Consolidation</h3>
                <p>Any solution should also consolidate and access all of a user’s
                accounts from one place. One of our participantsin our observations
                mentioned how it would be difficult to manage all his accounts. Four
                participants during the interviews mentioned that their vision for a
                product would include a way to input their various accounts such as
                social media or banking information. This would also include the feature
                to consolidate passwords.</p>
                <h3>Dead Man's Switch</h3>
                <p>Many of our interview participants mentioned that they have files
                they would want to be deleted once they passed. Gunther mentioned a dead
                man’s switch or some type of private key that a designated individual
                could use to send out notifications of their death and to delete files.
                More than half of our participants (n=25) in our interviews said that
                they have digital artifacts they would want to be deleted after they
                pass. This indicated that our design should include a feature to allow
                users to select which of their files should be kept and shared and which
                files should be deleted.</p>
                <h3>Memorial Page Creation</h3>
                <p>From our observations, and interviews we determined that participants
                had a favorable view towards online memorial pages and many would like
                one created for them in the event of their passing. The survey results
                showed less than half of the respondents (n=17) wanted a memorial page
                for themselves. This indicated that apart from creating a digital
                artifact package to be distributed, users would also benefit from having
                a choice to display chosen artifacts with friends and family. Based on
                the findings from the surveys the memorial should have features such as
                guest posting, signing book, and ways to add photos and videos.</p>
                    
                <h2>Retrospective</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Developed skills in conducting observations and interviews</li>
                    <li>Learned how to conduct remote observations and recordings</li>
