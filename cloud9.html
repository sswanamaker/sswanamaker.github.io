        <h3 class="heading">Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>The widespread adoption of technologies and social media brings to
        question, what will happen to these digital assets (digital photos,
        videos, documents, etc.) after the users pass away? In this project, we
        explored user needs for a technology addressing this problem that
        considers the wishes of the deceased person. We began this project with
        scenario-based observations of eight participants. Our scenario asked
        participants to imagine themselves helping their critically ill aunt
        with their digital assets. We organized our notes from the observations
        using the AEIOU (activities, environment, interactions, objects, and
        users) framework. </p>
        <p>After performing our observations, we recruited eight new
        participants to take part in interviews. After receiving consent, we
        asked them questions about storing/sharing digital assets, potential
        preparations for assets after passing, and about any accounts they may
        have. We analyzed our interview by coding, creating an affinity diagram
        on Mural.com, spectrums, and personas.</p>
        <p>In the final stage of our research, we performed a survey with 47
        participants. We asked them questions about how their digital assets
        should be handled after they died, as well as their comfort level with
        someone else handling them. We also asked if participants were
        interested in digital memorials created in their honor as well as their
        social media use. From our findings, we learned that users prefer their
        artifacts to be handled by the following in order: friends, siblings,
        then parents. We also learned that users like the idea of memorials but
        would not want to make one for themselves, and the management of their
        social media accounts are not very important.</p>
        <p>Major implications of the design of our technology are as follows:</p>
        <div class="implications">
            <p>• <span class="bold">‘How-to’ guide</span> – All users encountered difficulty when it came to
            finding information on how to organize social media presence. Based on
            this finding we would need to have precise instructions or
            recommendations on how to organize social media accounts when developing
            and designing this product.</p>
            <p>• <span class="bold">Consolidation feature</span> – Several users wanted a feature to
            consolidate their social media accounts.</p>
            <p>• <span class="bold">Cloud service</span> – All our participants stored their digital assets in
            the cloud. This finding indicated that our product would have to be a
            cloud-based product that is easily accessible from the participant’s
            browsers.</p>
            <p>• <span class="bold">Dead man’s switch</span> – Users wanted a feature where preselected files
            and/or accounts will be deleted once they are gone. Any design will need
            to include a feature where users can select what files or accounts to
            keep or delete, and a private key that they or a designated individual
            can input to activate this feature.</p>
            <p>• <span class="bold">Memorial page creation</span> – From our observations, and interviews we
            determined that participants had a favorable view towards online
            memorial pages, and many would like one created for them in the event of
            their passing. However, the surveys found that only half of the
            respondents would want to set up a memorial page for themselves. This
            indicated that our design should include an optional feature of creating
            a memorial page that will showcase and present digital artifacts that
            users designate.</p>
        </div>   
    </div>
    <div class="observation">
        <h3 class="heading">Observation</h3>
        <p>We began our exploration by observering how participants would share
        their loved one's digital artifacts in preparation for their loved one's
        passing. We recruited eight participants through social media. Due to
        the Covid-19 epidemic, we conducted our observations through Zoom.</p>
        <p>We then sent each participant a document with written instructions
        and stock photos to for use in a solving a scenario-based problem:</p>
        <p class="task">Imagine your aunt, an avid photographer and writer, is
        critically ill; everyone in the family is distraught and shocked at how
        swiftly her condition worsened. You, being the most versed in
        technology, are asked to help your aunt with organizing her digital
        assets and social media accounts so she can share her collected
        artifacts with her family and friends when she is gone.</p>
        <p>After presenting the scenario, we gave them two tasks: (1) Using the
        photos we sent earlier, please demonstrate, while sharing your screen,
        how you would store and share these sentimental digital files, the
        photo's of your aunt's 50th birthday with your aunt's close family
        members once she is gone; (2) Show how you would help your aunt organize
        her social media presence.</p>
        <p>From there, we organized our observations into the AEIOU framework to
        categorize our findings using Stormboard, an online affinity
        diagramming tool. We then summarized common steps into a flow
        diagram.</p>
        <div class="obsdiagram">
            <div class="diagram1">
                <img class="diagram" src="images/diagram1.jpg">
                <p>In our observations, we noted that most participants uploaded
                the stock photos to a cloud service (e.g Google Drive or Adobe
                Lightroom) in order to share the photos.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="diagram2">
                <img class="diagram" src="images/diagram2.jpg">
                <p>Our participants prefered to also use the cloud for storing
                their digital artifacts, while some also placed the artifacts in
                a secondary location such as their local computer drive or an
                external drive. When participants stored the digital artifacts,
                they created folders and most labled it "Aunt's 50th Birthday"
                in order to keep their directories organized.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="diagram3">
                <img class="diagram" src="images/diagram3.jpg">
                <p>Participants came to various conclusions when deciding how
                they would organize their aunt's social media and digital
                artifacts. Three participants stated that they would go through
                the artifacts with their aunt to choose what to keep and what to
                delete. While others mentioned creating a memorial page,
                emailing or storing all the digital assets on the cloud so they
                could share the link with their family.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="diagram4">
                <img class="diagram" src="images/diagram4.jpg">
                <p>Many participants remarked that they did not know how they
                would go about completing the tasks that were presented. We
                observed that participants would turn to Google in order to find
                ideas and some wanted written instructions or checklists on what
                they should do.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>We then created a flow diagram to depict how our participants stored and shared digital artifacts.</p>
