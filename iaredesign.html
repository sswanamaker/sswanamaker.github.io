    <!--Project Overview-->
    <div class="projover">
        <h3 class="heading">Project Overview</h3>
        <p>The Legal Aid Society of San Diego is a non-profit that provides free legal
            services to lower income San Diego residents. The LASSD provides services to
            many areas such as health, housing, and economic hardships, but their
            information is arranged in a way where it is hard to find what you need.</p>
        <p>A majority of the site's users gain access through their phone's browsers. This
            creates frustrations as most of the page is taken up with navigation guides such
            as the hamburger menu, breadcrumb navigation menu, and another
            navigational menu on the bottom of the page. They also have users go through
            multitude of pages before arriving at the page they want. The categories are also
            not clearly labeled, causing users to go through multiple categories to see if it
            contains the information they need. There are also hidden pages such as
            appointment and contact forms that can only be found on certain pages.</p>
    </div>
    <!--Objective-->
    <div class="objective">
        <h3 class="heading">Objective</h3>
        <p>The goals for this project would be to rearrange the navigation so that there
            would be no need for multiple navigation bars, rearrange the information on the
            pages so it is one fluid page instead of multiple boxes of information, and make
            sure users do not have to go through multiple pages to arrive at the information
            they need. This will be achieved through accessing the current information
            architecture, finding areas that need improving and testing those assumptions.</p>
        <p>Some of the major content that users need to access are:</p>
        <div class="contentitems">
            <ul>
                <li>• Services provided by the firm and how to access these services</li>
                <ul class="indent">
                    <li>- Health</li>
                    <li>- Housing</li>
                    <li>- Support for families</li>
                    <li>- Economic stability</li>
                    <li>- Safety and stability</li>
                    <li>- Free clinics</li>
                </ul>
                <li>• Jobs provided at the firm</li>
                <li>• Donations to the firm</li>
                <li>• Publications</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <!--Content Inventory-->
    <div class="coninv">
        <h3 class="heading">Content Inventory</h3>
        <p>The content inventory focused on primary, secondary, and tertiary level
            navigation, with some quaternary items. The major and obvious problem was
            the multiple navigation system. The top and side navigation worked in the
            same way with the same content listed, so I noted it once on my inventory and
            focused on using the top navigation. There was information with links that
            took users to the same page on almost every page; this was also listed once in
            the inventory instead of repeated. Some pages were listed under multiple
            secondary navigation pages. There were many external links and PDFs
            scattered throughout the pages with minimal organization, which I noted on
            my inventory. There were some important pages (e.g. outreach form) which
            were given small links and hidden. Some pages required multiple clicks to
            reach.</p>
        <div class="pic">
            <img class="inventpic" src="images/ContentInventory1.jpg">
        </div>
    </div>
    <!--Card Sort-->
    <div class="card1">
        <h3 class="heading">Card Sort 1: Hybrid</h3>
        <p>The first card sort was not very effective
            in providing insight into content
            organization. There were 30 cards and 9 categories.</p>
        <div class="pic">
            <img class="card1pic" src="images/Cardsort0.PNG">
        </div>
        <p>The results came out varied across the four participants that
        completed the card sort. Some of the variations came from the lack of
        clarity of the cards. As the site is geared for legal services, many of
        the terms may have been unfamiliar to the participants, especially terms
        that are only relevant in California, such as "CalFresh" or "CalWorks".</p>
        <p>The categories, most which were the same as the ones listed on the
        site, left it open to interpretation. For example, the "Jobs" section
        was meant to be a category to house jobs or volunteer opportunities
        offered by the firm, not for cards that would help find jobs as most
        participants assumed.</p>
        <div class="take">
            <h4>Take Away</h4>
            <p>- Create better category titles that are
                more clear in their meaning</p>
            <p>- Add in definitions for terms so that
                participants can make better informed
                selection during sorts</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="card2">
        <h3 class="heading">Card Sort 2: Hybrid</h3>
        <p>The second card sort focused primarily
            on the services offered by the firm, as
            that is where the majority of the content
            resided. There were 19 cards and 6 categories.</p>
        <div class="pic">
            <img class="card2pic" src="images/Cardsort1.PNG">
        </div>
        <p>The results showed that participants sorted most cards into similar
        categories. Although there were 6 cards (highlighted in yellow) that
        users had trouble placing.</p>
        <div class="take">
            <h4>Take Away</h4>
            <p>- Create new categories or rename
                items for clarity for those that
                participants had trouble with</p>
            <p>- There were two new categories created after this sort:
            "Immigration" and "Consumer Protection". These two categories are
            meant to only contain one item each, as I could not come up with a
            category that better encompassed these two terms or a way to
            distribute and combine the other items</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="card3">
        <h3 class="heading">Card Sort 3: Hybrid</h3>
        <p>The third card sort placed the other items and categories from the
        site along with the new items and categories created from the second
        card sort. There were 19 cards and 6 categories.</p>
        <div class="pic">
            <img class="card3pic" src="images/Cardsort2.PNG">
        </div>
        <p>The results showed a consolidation of where participants sorted the
        items. The new categories ("Immigration", "Consumer Protection", "About
        the Firm", and "Jobs at the Firm") helped participant sort the items
        that were causing confusion in the first card sort.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="iatest">
        <h3 class="heading">IA Testing: Treejack</h3>
        <p>These are the tasks the were presented to the participants:</p>
        <div class="tasks">
            <ol>
                <li>1. You have applied to receive government assistance for food
                purchases (Cal Fresh), but you were denied. You want to request
                a hearing, but are not sure how to begin the process. Where
                would you go to find more information?</li>
                <li>2. You would like to gain the authority to manage your uncle's
                financial affairs as he cannot manage them himself due to mental
                limitations. You have found out that this is a court process
                called conservatorship. Where would you go to gain more
                information about this proceeding?</li>
                <li>3. You have witnessed your grandmother being abused by a
                caregiver at her nursery home. You want to find more information
                on what to do to get a restraining order against the caregiver
                for your grandmother.</li>
                <li>4. You are a permanent resident and would like help in your
                naturalization process to become a U.S. citizen. Where would you
                find this information?</li>
                <li>5. You are a retired attorney that wants to volunteer their
                time to the firm. Where would you go to find volunteer
                opportunities?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="tree1">
            <h4>Test 1</h4>
            <p>This test was done after the first card sort. It was of no
            surprise that the result and comments showed confusion from the
            participants. The success rates for all the tasks were low (70%) and
            one participant skipped the first task. Participants also seemed to
            backtrack and clicked through the navigation before selecting their
            choice. This showed that there really needed to be a more in-depth
            look into the categories I created and to go back to the card sort
            to create a better layout for my items. There were also issues of
            participants not being familiar with the terms as well.</p>
            <div class="pic">
                <img class="tree1pic" src="images/treejack0.jpg">
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="tree2">
            <h4>Test 2</h4>
            <p>The next treejack test made from the data gathered from the
            second and third card sort had much better success rates. The same
            tasks were used to measure improvements to the navigation layout.
            However, participants still struggled with the navigation,
            especially for the first task. This turned out to be the task
            involving "CalFresh/CalWorks" which was a problem item in the card
            sort as well. This was something that needed to be addressed
            next.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pic">
            <img class="tree2pic" src="images/treejack1.jpg">
        </div>
        <div class="tree3">
            <h4>Test 3</h4>
            <p>This test was focused on the "CalFresh/CalWorks" item that caused
            confusion in the previous test. Based on the results from the treejack
            and the card sort, this item was divided into two, with an emphasis on
            food aid. "CalFresh" was placed in "Family Support" category. "CalWorks"
            was given the emphasis of cash aid and placed in the "Economic Support"
            category.</p>
            <p>Here are the tasks that were presented:</p>
            <div class="tasks">
                <ol>
                    <li>1. You are having trouble acquiring food and would like to
                    apply to CalFresh, a public assistance program to receive a food
                    stipend. You would like to seek help from the law firm in the
                    application process. Where would you go to find more
                    information?</li>
                    <li>2. You want to apply to CalWorks, a public assistance
                    program, to receive cash benefits, but you are having a hard
                    time with the process and would like to seek help from the law
                    firm. Where would you go to find more information?</li>
                </ol>

            having a larger font so users do not feel like they have to aim to

        <h3 class="heading">Wireframe</h3>
        <p>The wireframe was created with the sitemap in mind. The biggest
        difficulty was finding a way to present all of the items in the
        "Service" categories without having the user go through multiple pages
        or clicking through the navigation panel. The solution was to create a
        "Service" page that contained cards with category titles. Clicking on
        the card would "flip" it over showing the individual items under the
        category. This way the user can look through multiple cards, if they
        have to, without having to click through pages to find their items.</p>

        <h3 class="heading">Retrospective</h3>
        <p>There was a lot of trial and error throughout this process. In
        theory, the individual steps seemed easy to do, but I messed up several
        times even setting up a card sort. A lot of thought and careful planning
        has to go into setting up the tests. I realized that wording and intent
        of a term is sometimes hard to convey, especially for law terms that
        have rigid definitions.</p>
        <p>I was also surprised a lot of the time in where users showed struggle
        with sorting certain cards or finding a certain page. It shows that no
        matter how well you think you've organized something, it doesn't always
        work for other people.</p>
        <p>There were certain areas I would have liked to explore more deeply,
        especially the "Publication" section that I didn't have the time to go
        more into detail with. I think the sections under service could also be
        organized a little better, maybe with more precise category and page
        labels. I had a little difficulty creating categories that went beyond
        what was already offered on the site. I would like to see if I could
        create different categories that could possibly combine some items or
        category titles that can better translate the intent behind it.</p>
