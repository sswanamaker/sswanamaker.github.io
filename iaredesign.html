                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>The Legal Aid Society of San Diego (LASSD) is a non-profit that
                provides free legal services to lower income San Diego residents.
                The LASSD provides services to many areas such as health, housing,
                and economic hardships, but their information is arranged in a way
                where it is hard for users to find what they need quickly. As most
                users that visit that site are in need of help, reducing stress in
                an already strenuous situation will be effective in providing the
                best care for users.</p>
                <h4>Problems</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The mobile website (how majority of users access the site)
                    contains three different types of navigation (hamburger,
                    breadcrumb, footer navigation)</li>
                    <li>The navigation labels are not clearly named</li>
                    <li>Some important forms (contact and appointment) are hidden</li>
                </ul>
            </div>  
        </div>

            <div class="col">
                <h5>Role</h5>
                <p>Conducting content inventory</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>The goals for this project would be to rearrange the navigation
                so users will be able to find the information they need quickly and
                efficiently. This will be achieved through accessing the current
                information architecture, finding areas that need improving and
                testing those assumptions.</p>

                <h2>Content Inventory</h2>
                <p>The content inventory focused on primary, secondary, and
                    tertiary level navigation, with some quaternary items. The major
                    and obvious problem was the multiple navigation system. The top
                    and side navigation contained the same content, so I noted it
                    once on my inventory and focused on using the top navigation.
                    Some pages were listed under multiple secondary navigation
                    pages. There were many external links and PDFs scattered
                    throughout the pages with minimal organization, which I noted on
                    my inventory. There were some important pages (e.g. outreach
                    form) which were linked in the middle of some pages. </p>

                <h2>Card Sort</h2>
                <h4>Sort 1: Hybrid</h4>
                <p>The first card sort was not very effective in providing
                insight into content organization. There were 30 cards and 9
                categories.</p>
                <p>The results came out varied across the four participants that
                completed the card sort. Some of the variations came from the
                lack of clarity of the cards. As the site is geared for legal
                services, many of the terms may have been unfamiliar to the
                participants, especially terms that are only relevant in
                California, such as "CalFresh" or "CalWorks".</p>

                meaning</li>

                <h4 class="pt-2">Sort 2: Hybrid</h4>
                <p>The second card sort focused primarily on the services
                offered by the firm, as that is where the majority of the
                content resided. There were 19 cards and 6 categories. The
                results showed that participants sorted most cards into similar
                categories. Although there were 6 cards (highlighted in yellow)
                that users had trouble placing.</p>

                that participants had trouble with</li>
                <li>There were two new categories created after this sort:
                "Immigration" and "Consumer Protection". These two categories
                are meant to only contain one item each, as I could not come up
                with a category that better encompassed these two terms or a way
                to distribute and combine the other items.</li>

                <h4 class="pt-2">Sort 3: Hybrid</h4>
                <p>The third card sort placed the other items and categories
                from the site along with the new items and categories created
                from the second card sort. There were 19 cards and 6
                categories.</p>
                <p>The results showed more consolidation of cards. The new
                categories ("Immigration", "Consumer Protection", "About the
                Firm", and "Jobs at the Firm") helped participants sort the
                items that were creating confusion in the first card sort.</p>
                
                <h2>IA Testing: Treejack</h2>
                <p>The first two tests involved 5 tasks participants had to
                complete regarding the navigation menu. The third test involved
                two tasks which were used to clear up confusion regarding a
                couple of navigational labels.</p>
                <h4>Test 1</h4>
                <p>This test was done after the first card sort. It was of no
                surprise that the result and comments showed confusion from the
                participants. The success rates for all the tasks were low (70%)
                and participants also spent time looking through the navigation
                tree. This showed that there really needed to be a more in-depth
                look into the categories I created and to go back to the card
                sort to create a better layout for my items. </p>

                <h4>Test 2</h4>
                <p>The next treejack test made from the data gathered from the
                second and third card sort had much better success rates. The
                same tasks were used to measure improvements to the navigation
                layout. However, participants still struggled with the
                navigation, especially for the first task. This turned out to be
                the task involving "CalFresh/CalWorks" which was a problem item
                in the card sort as well. This was due to an oversite on my part
                as CalFresh/CalWorks is a California specific program.</p>

                <h4>Test 3</h4>
                <p>This test was focused on the "CalFresh/CalWorks" item that
                caused confusion in the previous test. The new labels and
                categories provided a 100% success rate on both tasks with 5
                participants.</p>

                <h2>Mid-fi Wireframe</h2>
                <p>The wireframe was created with the sitemap in mind. The
                biggest difficulty was finding a way to present all of the items
                in the "Service" categories without having the user go through
                multiple pages or clicking through the navigation panel. The
                solution was to create a "Service" page that contained dropdown
                menus with category titles. Clicking on the title or arrow would
                reveal the individual items under the category. This way the
                user can view multiple categories at once and make a decision on
                which would best have the information they need.</p>
