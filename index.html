        <h1 class="name">Hi! I'm <span id="name">Samantha</span>!</h1>
        <p>I am completing my masters in Human Computer Interaction at DePaul
        University. After finishing my  Bachelors of Science in Psychology at
        University of California, Davis, I began working as a teacher for
        autistic students at a charity organization. Learning how to teach
        students who require different methods to process information, I began
        to be interested in user experience.</p> 
        <p>This past year, the courses that I have taken have taught me skills
        in identifying target users and creating scenarios and storyboards to
        help facilitate development of a product geared towards users. I have
        also developed skills in creating wireframes and prototypes, and using
        iterative development to improve on those prototypes by testing it
        against users.</p>
        <p>I am looking  to implement and improve on my
        skills in any opportunity that I receive.</p>
