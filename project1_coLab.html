        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>D2L coLab is an app designed to allow students to communicate about
        group projects. The app is intended to help in-class and online students
        collaborate on assignments. The app will integrate with the D2L (Desire
        to Learn) learning-management system, which is used by universities
        nationwide. The app gives students the ability to set up video meetings
        with classmates, participate in online chat sessions, have easy access
        to assignments from instructors, collaborate on shared documents, and
        assist with project management by allowing students to create and assign
        tasks to other team members and manage a team calendar. The app is
        available on both desktop and mobile in order to meet students where
        they are.</p>
    </div>
    <!--project goals-->
    <div class="goal">
        <h3>Project Goals</h3>
        <p>- Create an effective way for students  to communicate with other
        students in their classes</p>
        <p>- Ability to have video calls through the app</p>
        <p>- Create a way to facilitate group work through the app</p>
        <p>- Provide a way to add group tasks in the in-app calendar</p>
        <p>- Give ability to prioritize assigned work from class and assigned group tasks</p>
        <p>- Ability to add users’ availability schedule to the in-app calendar</p>
        <p>- Provide a checklist of assignments and tasks to help keep track of what needs to be done</p>
        <p>- Facilitate the interactions between in-class students of DePaul university with their online counterparts</p>

    <div class="personas">
        <h3>Personas</h3>
        <p>Once we realized our app idea and the goals we wanted to achieve
        through the app, we created  personas to get a better idea of the type
        of users we want to build the app for. As we wanted this app to be used
        in conjunction with the existing D2L website, both of our personas will
        be DePaul University students.</p>

                    <h4>In Class Student</h4>
                    <h4>30s</h4>
                    <h4>Full Time Worker</h4>
                </div>
                <p>Izzy is a graduate student in the HCI master’s program at DePaul
                University. She is in her mid-thirties, works full-time in downtown
                Chicago, and attends classes in-person. She chose DePaul’s program
                because the downtown location makes it convenient for her to attend
                classes after work. Even though she enjoys her classes, working on
                group projects can be difficult. She spends her weekends with her
                family and catching up on homework, so it can be difficult to
                schedule meetings with other students, especially online students.
                Since Izzy is so busy with work and family, she finds it hard to
                find time to stay on top of the email, D2L notifications, and Slack
                notifications (which is often used to work on group projects with
                online students).</p>

                </div>
                <p>Olivia is a graduate student in the HCI master’s program at
                    DePaul University. She is in her late twenties and works as a
                    freelance graphic designer. Even though she lives on the East Coast,
                    she chose DePaul’s program because it is offered completely online
                    and has a great reputation. Even though she enjoys her classes, she
                    sometimes finds it difficult to participate in group projects due to
                    scheduling issues and the lack of facetime with in-class students.
                    She also finds that her flexible freelance schedule and the time
                    difference makes it difficult to connect on projects, since most
                    students seem to work full-time and be on central time. </p>

            <h3>Design Charette</h3>
            <p>We began our design process with a design charrette where each member
            of our group created a few designs for the mobile and desktop
            application of our app. Then we shared and compared, picking the
            features we liked best from each of our designs and coming to a decision
            as to which ones we should incorporate into the app.</p>

            <p>-Set up a meeting via the calendar</p>

        <h3>Retrospective</h3>
        <p>I really like this idea of having everyone in the group present their
        vision of the app and discuss the positives and negatives of each. I
        think it really helped to narraw down on the type of features we wanted
        in our app and it also brought up some points we hadn’t considered yet,
        such as if the layout was going to look different for mobile and website
        versions. Next time, I would like to have more iternations of this
        process. I think after our first discussion we can go back and sketch
        individually our revised visions. This way we can refine our app more
        before going on to the prototyping phase. This was a good way to guage
        everyone’s expectation for the app and to make sure tha we were all on
        the same page before proceeding forward.</p>
