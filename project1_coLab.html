        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>D2L coLab is an app designed to allow students to communicate about
        group projects. The app is intended to help in-class and online students
        collaborate on assignments. The app will integrate with the D2L (Desire
        to Learn) learning-management system, which is used by universities
        nationwide. The app gives students the ability to set up video meetings
        with classmates, participate in online chat sessions, have easy access
        to assignments from instructors, collaborate on shared documents, and
        assist with project management by allowing students to create and assign
        tasks to other team members and manage a team calendar. The app is
        available on both desktop and mobile in order to meet students where
        they are.</p>
    </div>
    <!--project goals-->
    <div class="goal">
        <h3>Project Goals</h3>
        <p>- Create an effective way for students  to communicate with other
        students in their classes</p>
        <p>- Ability to have video calls through the app</p>
        <p>- Create a way to facilitate group work through the app</p>
        <p>- Provide a way to add group tasks in the in-app calendar</p>
        <p>- Give ability to prioritize assigned work from class and assigned group tasks</p>
        <p>- Ability to add users’ availability schedule to the in-app calendar</p>
        <p>- Provide a checklist of assignments and tasks to help keep track of what needs to be done</p>
        <p>- Facilitate the interactions between in-class students of DePaul university with their online counterparts</p>

        <h3>Design Tenets</h3>
        <p>These are the guiding principals our group kept in mind throughout this project:</p>
        <p>- Make it easy to access the features needed by the user</p>
        <p>- Make the number to steps needed to achieve a goal minimal</p>
        <p>- Users should be able to gather information on a page with a glance</p>
        <p>- Make it easy to collaborate, communicate, and coordinate</p>
    </div>
    <!--personas-->
    <div class="personas">
        <h3>Personas</h3>
        <p>Once we realized our app idea and the goals we wanted to achieve
        through the app, we created  personas to get a better idea of the type
        of users we want to build the app for. As we wanted this app to be used
        in conjunction with the existing D2L website, both of our personas will
        be DePaul University students.</p>

                    <h4>Izzy</h4>

                <p>Izzy is a graduate student in the HCI master’s program at DePaul
                University. She is in her mid-thirties, works full-time in downtown
                Chicago, and attends classes in-person. She chose DePaul’s program
                because the downtown location makes it convenient for her to attend
                classes after work. Even though she enjoys her classes, working on
                group projects can be difficult. She spends her weekends with her
                family and catching up on homework, so it can be difficult to
                schedule meetings with other students, especially online students.
                Since Izzy is so busy with work and family, she finds it hard to
                find time to stay on top of the email, D2L notifications, and Slack
                notifications (which is often used to work on group projects with
                online students).</p>

                <p>Olivia is a graduate student in the HCI master’s program at
                    DePaul University. She is in her late twenties and works as a
                    freelance graphic designer. Even though she lives on the East Coast,
                    she chose DePaul’s program because it is offered completely online
                    and has a great reputation. Even though she enjoys her classes, she
                    sometimes finds it difficult to participate in group projects due to
                    scheduling issues and the lack of facetime with in-class students.
                    She also finds that her flexible freelance schedule and the time
                    difference makes it difficult to connect on projects, since most
                    students seem to work full-time and be on central time. </p>

    <div class="scenarios">
        <h3>Scenarios</h3>
        <p>Once we created the personas, we made the scenarios to better showcase how they
            could benefit from D2L CoLab.</p>
        <h2>Izzy</h2>
        <p>Izzy is working on a group project for HCI 454 with two online students. Their project is
            due in one week and Izzy thinks it would be a good idea to meet with the group to
            discuss the status of their report. She opens the DePaul app, selects HCI 454, and
            opens the calendar to see the availability of her group mates. Izzy notices that everyone
            has availability the next day at 6pm, selects the group chat link, and messages her
            group mates to see if they can meet at that time. The two confirm that they are available
            and Izzy adds a group meeting to the calendar. Before the meeting, Izzy checks the
            task-list and compares it to the report. She checks off tasks that have been completed
            and prioritizes tasks that are not yet done. The next day, Izzy receives a notification of
            her upcoming meeting. The team reiterates tasks, confirms everyone is on the same
            page, and assigns Izzy to submit the final report once it is finished. Izzy and her group
            mates finish the final tasks and edit the report throughout the week. The app notifies the
            group the day before the report is due. Izzy messages the group to confirm with her
            group mates that the report is finalized. Through the app, Izzy submit the final report
            and notifies everyone that it is successfully submitted.</p>
        <h2>Olivia</h2>
        <p>Olivia is taking HCI 445: Inquiry Methods and Use Analysis online for Winter Quarter
            2020. She was just assigned to a group project with three of her classmates. She
            opens the DePaul app and logs in to see her classes on the home screen. Olivia selects
            HCI 445 and sees her members’ names, her assigned tasks, and upcoming deadlines
            for the project on the home page. Olivia opens the apps’ calendar to add the days and
            times she is available to meet. She then clicks on a link to a chat room with her group
            mates and types a message to introduce herself. She then receives chat messages
            from the other members within the next 15 minutes. Olivia and her group members have
            to submit a report introduction, interview notes, and an affinity diagram in two weeks.
            Olivia opens the menu to select the group’s task-list and sees that another group
            member has added the tasks and their appropriate deadlines. She assigns herself the
            task to write the introduction. Olivia finishes the introduction a week early and posts it on
            the group’s document in the app for her group members to review it.</p>

            <h3>Design Charette</h3>
            <p>We began our design process with a design charrette where each member
            of our group created a few designs for the mobile and desktop
            application of our app. Then we shared and compared, picking the
            features we liked best from each of our designs and coming to a decision
            as to which ones we should incorporate into the app.</p>

            and get the green light for the project.</p>
        <p>To accomplish this, we created a digital narrative prototype (aka, a video) that
            presented our ideas in their full glory.</p>

    <div class="prototype">
        <h3>Mid-Fi Prototype</h3>
        <p>With the goal of user testing in mind, we began creating our mid-fi
        prototypes. We created our prototype through Figma, keeping in mind our
        project goals and the final sketch we created from our design charrette.
        As we had a lot of features we wanted to create, we decided in order to
        keep the length of testing to a reasonable amount and to get the best
        feedback, we would focus on the most important aspects of our app -
        messages, with video call/meeting set-up features, and the calendar,
        with the ability to create tasks for group members and set up
        meetings.</p>
        <div class="mobile1">
            <h2>Mobile</h2>
            <p>We created a mobile page for a calendar where users can view
            assignments that are due for their classes. Users can also add in
            their own events, such as self created due dates, for group work
            which will be shared on to their group members calendar as well. The
            right page is our chat function where users can communicate with
            students in their class and form group chats for working on
            assignments. The chat functions allows users to share documents,
            audio, and photos, and also set up meetings, whether it is for a
            physical meetup or a virtual one. The video icon on the top allows
            users to start a video conference which can also be recorded and
            posted in the chat.</p>
            <div class="mobileproto1">

            </div>
            <p>From our first presentation of our app to the class, there was a
            remark that we should make the recording function more obvious to
            the user. Previously, we just had a camera icon in place, but in our
            new edit we also placed a label so users will know exactly what this
            function is.</p>
            <div class="mobileproto1">
                <img class="conference" src="images/mid_video.jpg">

        </div>
        
        <div class="desktop1">
            <h2>Desktop</h2>
            <p>The desktop version shows an assignments page where users can
            view upcoming assignments that are due for their classes. On this
            page users can also assign tasks related to an assignment to members
            of their group and set deadlines. Users can also mark their task as
            complete so their group members know the status of their
            assignments. We did not create a prototype of this page in the
            mobile version as we wanted to test the viability of an assignment's
            tab because it was somewhat similar in function to the calendar
            page. The second page is the prototype for the calendar tab. It is
            similar to the mobile view, but allows the user to view the whole
            month and the assignments listed on the calendar are color coded by
            class. The third page is the messages tab. This is also similar to
            the mobile style, but allows users to switch between the different
            chats on the same page.</p>

        <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
        <p>Once we were happy with our prototype, we created the script to use
        for our user testing. We decided to have each task tested separately by
        mobile and desktop and by participant (barring one participant who
        completed both mobile and desktop tasks). We chose our participants
        based on our personas; we needed participants that were familiar with
        D2L or another comparable educational institution's learning-management
        system.</p>
        <div class="tasks">
            <h2>Tasks</h2>
            <p>We asked our participants to complete four tasks:</p>
            <p>1. Set up a meeting in the chatroom</p>
            <p>2. Set up a meeting via the calendar</p>
            <p>3. Assign a task to team member via the calendar</p>
            <p>4. Assign a task to a team member via a report (an assignment)</p>
            <p>The first two tasks are similar as we created two different ways
            to create a meeting in our wireframes and we wanted to test which
            method the participants would prefer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="outcome">
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>We recruited six participants (3 participants for each mobile and
            desktop prototypes). After completing each task, we asked the
            participant to rate it's difficulty on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being
            very easy and 10 being very difficult.</p>
            <img class="chart" src="images/findings.jpg">
            <p>After discussing the results of testing, the group noted that the
            following observations were made amongst the majority of test
            participants:</p>
            <p>- Participants found setting up a meeting via the calendar more
            intuitive than setting up a meeting in the chatroom</p>
            <p>- When in the calendar, it was difficult to see how to add a new
            entry since the “add” icon was towards the bottom of the screen</p>
            <p>- In the calendar (desktop), participants were confused about the
            different calendar“views” presented in the right-hand menu.</p>
            <p>- When in the chatroom, users did not expect to find the option to
            set up a meeting in the “+” menu. They associate “+” menus with
            adding a photo or document to a chat. They expressed preference for
            a more intuitive “calendar” icon outside of the “+" menu</p>
            <p>-Participants expressed confusion over the difference between an
            “Assignment”and a “Task”</p>
            <p>- Participants were also confused about the difference between
            “self tasks” and“group tasks”</p>
            <p>Taking in all of our findings, we realized that we needed to improve
            our design in order to reduce the difficulty participants had with
            their tasks. We also needed to keep participants comments in mind
            when going forward with our next iteration of our design.</p>

        <h3>Hi-Fi Prototypes</h3>
        <!--calendar improvements-->
        <div class="calendar">
            <h2>Improvement 1: Calendar</h2>
            <p>One of the general comments among all of the testers was that the
            plus icon did not seem intuitive for something such as the task of
            setting up a meeting. One tester had explained that “...having the
            option to add an audio or adding a photo seemed logical to put
            inside the plus icon… for setting up a meeting it seemed out of
            place.” What the team had agreed to make it more obvious, and some
            feedback from the testers was to provide a calendar icon that would
            display the option to set up a meeting. From there, the user tapping
            on the calendar icon would redirect the user to the calendar page to
            complete the rest of the task. The next step from here would be to
            make sure tha tthe calendar follows the feedback that the users have
            given such as adding more space and separating the calendar and the
            events on the specific days to provide more space for a user to
            select specific elements.</p>

            <p>We adopted a similar method for the desktop version of the chat
            screen. Since there is more space in the desktop, we opted to get
            rid of the plus icon and instead spread out the features using
            icons.</p>

            <h2>Improvement 2: Plus Icon</h2>
            <p>Another thing that was mentioned by a few of the users was that
            the plus icon on the calendar did not create enough contrast with
            the rest of the screen, so this was confusing for users. One user
            added a comment “...the plus icon looks exactly like the rest of the
            screen, if there was a way to maybe change the color of the button
            or make it stand out, this would make it more obvious to me.” The
            team had decided that green would be a great contrast color against
            the white background and gray text and elements to display that this
            has is something that is allowed to be pressed on. The next step for
            this would be to make sure that the script follows the prototype and
            continues through the process that allows a user to understand that
            the task has been completed. Such as once a new task has been added,
            it will appear at the top of the list and in a darker shade than the
            other events to make a distinction.</p>

            </div>
            <p>We also added a create icon in the desktop version of the
            calendar as well. Some participants found it difficult to finish the
            task involving the calendar as they did not notice the plus icon on
            the bottom right. So we moved it to a more prominent place at the
            top of the screen and gave it a brighter color as well.</p>

            <h2>Improvement 3: Tasks</h2>
            <p>The last general feedback given from the users when testing was
            that it seemed out of place that the self task and the group tasks
            were seperated. One of the users had said “...it seems that since
            the same people are showing up for both tasks, can you just combine
            the two?” So what the team has decided that the best option to
            further improve coLab was to combine the two, and when the user taps
            to add a task this will appear with the specific class selected as
            well as the names of the team members that are in that class. From
            there, they have the ability to further continue finishing the task
            at hand. The next step for this screen would be to further improve
            the task described and make sure that all screens show the
            appropriate information. Such as making sure that the calendar
            displays the March calendar for a user task that is supposed to
            assign a task to a team member for a date in March. 12</p>

            </div>
            <p>We did similar updates to the desktop screen and combined the two
            task features into one. We also added the option to change the views
            of the calendar such as viewing only one class's calendar
            events.</p>

    <!--style tile-->
    <div class="style">
        <h3>Style Tile</h3>
        <p>The thing that was most important when creating the style tile was to
        make sure that all of the elements that were added onto the page
        followed the idea and style that all team members had decided on. We
        wanted to make sure that the style was simplistic and made sure that all
        areas of importance contained a larger text and displayed in a way that
        would allow the user to make sure they knew how each element would
        function. The colors were taken from Coolors.co that will auto generate
        colors to create a theme that would work for the specific idea that you
        are working towards. We had already wanted the same or similar blue
        color from D2L to consistently match that website and every other color
        would just be a complementary color.</p>
        <p>The buttons differ from the regular text in order to indicate that a
        user is able to click on that button. An outline means that the button
        has not been selected yet, while a filled button means that it has been
        selected. The feedback implies that some action has been done. We wanted
        a font that was familiar and comfortable to users who are familiar with
        the D2L website. We chose Open Sans in regular and semibold, depending
        on the level of importance for the element on the screen.</p>

            <h3>Retrospective</h3>
            <p>I really like this idea of having everyone in the group present their
            vision of the app and discuss the positives and negatives of each. I
            think it really helped to narraw down on the type of features we wanted
            in our app and it also brought up some points we hadn’t considered yet,
            such as if the layout was going to look different for mobile and website
            versions. Next time, I would like to have more iternations of this
            process. I think after our first discussion we can go back and sketch
            individually our revised visions. This way we can refine our app more
            before going on to the prototyping phase. This was a good way to guage
            everyone’s expectation for the app and to make sure tha we were all on
            the same page before proceeding forward.</p>
            <p>Looking at the current iteration of D2L coLab, there are
            definitely additional areas to flesh out for the project. We
            received great feedback from our users, but believe that more
            testing would be useful if we developed the full task functionality.
            The assignments tab was a little clunky and a lot of participants
            had trouble with the task associated with that feature. While the
            idea is good, the execution was lacking and more insight should be
            gained to better promote collaboration between students. The idea of
            assigning task to different users in a group should be tested
            further as well. We struggled finding a way to differentiate the
            steps users might take in an assignment (such as coming up with an
            outline or delagating parts of a paper to different students) from
            assignments directed from the professor, while keeping both features
            in the same locations.</p>
            <p>We learned through this project that combining the different
            ideas that each member had for the app was a difficult process and
            required clear communication and compromises from each member of the
            group. While the target audience of the app were users similar to
            ourselves, it was interesting to see that some users saw certain
            functions as unnecessary or had a hard time navigating during the
            user testing. It highlighted the necessity of user testing in order
            to create the best product possible.</p>
