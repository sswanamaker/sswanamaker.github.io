        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>D2L coLab is an app designed to allow students to communicate about
        group projects. The app is intended to help in-class and online students
        collaborate on assignments. The app will integrate with the D2L (Desire
        to Learn) learning-management system, which is used by universities
        nationwide. The app gives students the ability to set up video meetings
        with classmates, participate in online chat sessions, have easy access
        to assignments from instructors, collaborate on shared documents, and
        assist with project management by allowing students to create and assign
        tasks to other team members and manage a team calendar. The app is
        available on both desktop and mobile in order to meet students where
        they are.</p>
    </div>
    <!--project goals-->
    <div class="goal">
        <h3>Project Goals</h3>
        <p>- Create an effective way for students  to communicate with other
        students in their classes</p>
        <p>- Ability to have video calls through the app</p>
        <p>- Create a way to facilitate group work through the app</p>
        <p>- Provide a way to add group tasks in the in-app calendar</p>
        <p>- Give ability to prioritize assigned work from class and assigned group tasks</p>
        <p>- Ability to add users’ availability schedule to the in-app calendar</p>
        <p>- Provide a checklist of assignments and tasks to help keep track of what needs to be done</p>
        <p>- Facilitate the interactions between in-class students of DePaul university with their online counterparts</p>

        <h3>Design Tenets</h3>
        <p>These are the guiding principals our group kept in mind throughout this project:</p>
        <p>- Make it easy to access the features needed by the user</p>
        <p>- Make the number to steps needed to achieve a goal minimal</p>
        <p>- Users should be able to gather information on a page with a glance</p>
        <p>- Make it easy to collaborate, communicate, and coordinate</p>
    </div>
    <!--personas-->
    <div class="personas">
        <h3>Personas</h3>
        <p>Once we realized our app idea and the goals we wanted to achieve
        through the app, we created  personas to get a better idea of the type
        of users we want to build the app for. As we wanted this app to be used
        in conjunction with the existing D2L website, both of our personas will
        be DePaul University students.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Izzy is a graduate student in the HCI master’s program at DePaul
                University. She is in her mid-thirties, works full-time in downtown
                Chicago, and attends classes in-person. She chose DePaul’s program
                because the downtown location makes it convenient for her to attend
                classes after work. Even though she enjoys her classes, working on
                group projects can be difficult. She spends her weekends with her
                family and catching up on homework, so it can be difficult to
                schedule meetings with other students, especially online students.
                Since Izzy is so busy with work and family, she finds it hard to
                find time to stay on top of the email, D2L notifications, and Slack
                notifications (which is often used to work on group projects with
                online students).</p>

                <p>Olivia is a graduate student in the HCI master’s program at
                    DePaul University. She is in her late twenties and works as a
                    freelance graphic designer. Even though she lives on the East Coast,
                    she chose DePaul’s program because it is offered completely online
                    and has a great reputation. Even though she enjoys her classes, she
                    sometimes finds it difficult to participate in group projects due to
                    scheduling issues and the lack of facetime with in-class students.
                    She also finds that her flexible freelance schedule and the time
                    difference makes it difficult to connect on projects, since most
                    students seem to work full-time and be on central time. </p>

    <div class="scenarios">
        <h3>Scenarios</h3>
        <p>Once we created the personas, we made the scenarios to better showcase how they
            could benefit from D2L CoLab.</p>
        <h4>Izzy</h4>
        <p>Izzy is working on a group project for HCI 454 with two online students. Their project is
            due in one week and Izzy thinks it would be a good idea to meet with the group to
            discuss the status of their report. She opens the DePaul app, selects HCI 454, and
            opens the calendar to see the availability of her group mates. Izzy notices that everyone
            has availability the next day at 6pm, selects the group chat link, and messages her
            group mates to see if they can meet at that time. The two confirm that they are available
            and Izzy adds a group meeting to the calendar. Before the meeting, Izzy checks the
            task-list and compares it to the report. She checks off tasks that have been completed
            and prioritizes tasks that are not yet done. The next day, Izzy receives a notification of
            her upcoming meeting. The team reiterates tasks, confirms everyone is on the same
            page, and assigns Izzy to submit the final report once it is finished. Izzy and her group
            mates finish the final tasks and edit the report throughout the week. The app notifies the
            group the day before the report is due. Izzy messages the group to confirm with her
            group mates that the report is finalized. Through the app, Izzy submit the final report
            and notifies everyone that it is successfully submitted.</p>
        <h4>Olivia</h4>
        <p>Olivia is taking HCI 445: Inquiry Methods and Use Analysis online for Winter Quarter
            2020. She was just assigned to a group project with three of her classmates. She
            opens the DePaul app and logs in to see her classes on the home screen. Olivia selects
            HCI 445 and sees her members’ names, her assigned tasks, and upcoming deadlines
            for the project on the home page. Olivia opens the apps’ calendar to add the days and
            times she is available to meet. She then clicks on a link to a chat room with her group
            mates and types a message to introduce herself. She then receives chat messages
            from the other members within the next 15 minutes. Olivia and her group members have
            to submit a report introduction, interview notes, and an affinity diagram in two weeks.
            Olivia opens the menu to select the group’s task-list and sees that another group
            member has added the tasks and their appropriate deadlines. She assigns herself the
            task to write the introduction. Olivia finishes the introduction a week early and posts it on
            the group’s document in the app for her group members to review it.</p>

            <h3>Design Charette</h3>
            <p>We began our design process with a design charrette where each member
            of our group created a few designs for the mobile and desktop
            application of our app. Then we shared and compared, picking the
            features we liked best from each of our designs and coming to a decision
            as to which ones we should incorporate into the app.</p>

        <h3>Digital Narrative</h3>
        <p>With our personas, scenarios, and sketches in hand, we were ready to present our idea
            to our stakeholders (i.e. our professor and our classmates) in order to earn their buy-in
            and get the green light for the project.</p>
        <p>To accomplish this, we created a digital narrative prototype (aka, a video) that
            presented our ideas in their full glory.</p>

        <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
        <div class="tasks">
            <h4>Tasks</h4>
            <p>We asked our participants to complete four tasks:</p>
            <p>1. Set up a meeting in the chatroom</p>
            <p>2. Set up a meeting via the calendar</p>
            <p>3. Assign a task to team member via the calendar</p>
            <p>4. Assign a task to a team member via a report (an assignment)</p>
            <p>The first two tasks are similar as we created two different ways
            to create a meeting in our wireframes and we wanted to test which
            method the participants would prefer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="outcome">
            <h4>Outcome</h4>
            <p>We recruited six participants (3 participants for each mobile and
            desktop prototypes). After completing each task, we asked the
            participant to rate it's difficulty on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being
            very easy and 10 being very difficult.</p>
            <div class="image-placeholder">
                <h4>findings chart</h4>
            </div>
            <p>After discussing the results of testing, the group noted that the
            following observations were made amongst the majority of test
            participants:</p>
            <p>- Participants found setting up a meeting via the calendar more
            intuitive than setting up a meeting in the chatroom</p>
            <p>- When in the calendar, it was difficult to see how to add a new
            entry since the“add” icon was towards the bottom of the screen</p>
            <p>- When in the chatroom, users did not expect to find the option to
            set up a meeting in the “+” menu. They associate “+” menus with
            adding a photo or document to a chat. They expressed preference for
            a more intuitive “calendar” icon outside of the “+" menu</p>
            <p>Taking in all of our findings, we realized that we needed to improve
            our design in order to reduce the difficulty participants had with
            their tasks. We also needed to keep participants comments in mind
            when going forward with our next iteration of our design.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <!--next iternation-->
    <div class="new">
        <h3>Prototype 2</h3>
        <div class="calendar">
            <div class="image-placeholder">
                <h4>mobile chat calendar</h4>
            </div>
            <p>As many participants remarked that setting up a meeting through
            the message function to be unintuitive, we decided to create a
            calendar icon that would take the user to the calendar where they
            could set up a meeting.</p>
            <div class="image-placeholder">
                <h4>desktop chat calendar</h4>
            </div>
            <p>We adopted a similar method for the desktop version of the chat
            screen. Since there is more space in the desktop, we opted to get
            rid of the plus icon and instead spread out the features using
            icons.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="plus">
            <div class="image-placeholder">
                <h4>mobile plus</h4>
            </div>
            <p>Another comment we had was to the visibility of the plus icon in
            the calendar. As it was not immediately observable to the user, we
            changed the color of the icon to better grab the users’ attention so
            they can find the features of the calendar faster. 18</p>
            <div class="image-placeholder">
                <h4>desktop plus</h4>
            </div>
            <p>We also added a create icon in the desktop version of the
            calendar as well. Some participants found it difficult to finish the
            task involving the calendar as they did not notice the plus icon on
            the bottom right. So we moved it to a more prominent place at the
            top of the screen and gave it a brighter color as well.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <!--retrospective-->
    <div class="restrospective">
        <h3>Retrospective</h3>
        <p>I really like this idea of having everyone in the group present their
        vision of the app and discuss the positives and negatives of each. I
        think it really helped to narraw down on the type of features we wanted
        in our app and it also brought up some points we hadn’t considered yet,
        such as if the layout was going to look different for mobile and website
        versions. Next time, I would like to have more iternations of this
        process. I think after our first discussion we can go back and sketch
        individually our revised visions. This way we can refine our app more
        before going on to the prototyping phase. This was a good way to guage
        everyone’s expectation for the app and to make sure tha we were all on
        the same page before proceeding forward.</p>
